## 🔹 Step 2: Login to the faulty server for diagnosis

**On App Server 1 (login as tony):**

```bash
sudo su -
```

**Purpose**: Switch to root user for administrative troubleshooting tasks.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Check Apache service detailed status

```bash
systemctl status httpd -l
```

**Purpose**: Check the detailed status of Apache service to identify specific failure reasons.

**Problem Output Example**:
```
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code)
   Process: 1234 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
   Main PID: 1234 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
   
Error: (98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:8084
```

**Issue Found**: 🔍 **Apache failing due to bind error on port 8084**

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Identify process using the conflicting port

```bash
netstat -luntp | grep 8084
```

**Purpose**: Show which process is listening on the conflicting port.

**Problem Output Example**:
```
tcp    0    0 127.0.0.1:8084    0.0.0.0:*    LISTEN    757/sendmail
```

**Issue Found**: 🔍 **Sendmail is occupying port 8084 (PID 757)**

**Alternative commands**:
```bash
ss -luntp | grep 8084
lsof -i :8084
```

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Terminate the conflicting process

```bash
kill 757
```

**Purpose**: Kill the conflicting process to free the port for Apache.

**Verify port is freed**:
```bash
netstat -luntp | grep 8084
```

**Expected Result**: No output (port is now available)

**Status**: ✅ **Port 8084 is now free for Apache**

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Configure Apache to use port 5003

```bash
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

**Purpose**: Modify Apache main configuration to listen on port 5003 instead of default ports.

**Configuration Changes Required**:

**Find and modify these lines:**
```apache
# Change from:
Listen 80
Listen 8084

# Change to:
Listen 5003
```

**Additional configuration file (if exists)**:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/your-custom.conf
```

**Add or modify**:
```apache
Listen 5003
<VirtualHost *:5003>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>
```

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Verify Apache configuration syntax

```bash
sudo httpd -t
```

**Purpose**: Test Apache configuration syntax before restarting the service.

**Expected Output**:
```
Syntax OK
```

**If errors found**: Review and fix configuration files before proceeding.

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Restart Apache service

```bash
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd
```

**Purpose**: Restart Apache service and verify it starts successfully with new port configuration.

**Expected Output**:
```
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: active (running)
   Main PID: 1456 (httpd)
   Process: 1455 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

**Status**: ✅ **Apache is now active and running**

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Verify Apache is listening on port 5003

```bash
netstat -luntp | grep 5003
```

**Purpose**: Confirm Apache is listening on the correct port 5003.

**Expected Output**:
```
tcp6    0    0 :::5003    :::*    LISTEN    1456/httpd
```

**Additional verification**:
```bash
ss -luntp | grep 5003
curl -I http://localhost:5003
```

---

## 🔹 Step 10: Test local connectivity

```bash
curl http://localhost:5003
```

**Purpose**: Test Apache response locally on the server.

**Expected Output**: Apache default page or basic HTTP response

**Status**: ✅ **Local connectivity confirmed**

---

## 🔹 Step 11: Check and configure other app servers

**Repeat Steps 2-10 on App Server 2 and App Server 3:**

```bash
# On stapp02 (login as steve)
sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# (Change Listen directive to 5003)
sudo systemctl restart httpd

# On stapp03 (login as banner)  
sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# (Change Listen directive to 5003)
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

**Purpose**: Ensure all app servers are configured consistently to run Apache on port 5003.

---

## 🔹 Step 12: Final connectivity testing from Jump Host

**From Jump Host:**

```bash
curl http://stapp01:5003
curl http://stapp02:5003
curl http://stapp03:5003
```

**Purpose**: Test reachability from Jump Host for all app servers to confirm consistent configuration.

**Expected Results**: ✅ **All servers should return HTTP responses**

**HTTP test with headers**:
```bash
curl -I http://stapp01:5003
curl -I http://stapp02:5003
curl -I http://stapp03:5003
```

---

## 🔹 Step 13: Enable Apache service for auto-start

**On all app servers:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

**Purpose**: Ensure Apache starts automatically on system boot.

**Verify service status**:
```bash
systemctl is-enabled httpd
systemctl list-unit-files | grep httpd
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Configuration syntax errors**
**Symptoms**: Apache fails to start after config changes
**Solution**: Use `httpd -t` to check syntax and fix errors
```bash
sudo httpd -t
sudo tail /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

### **Issue 2: SELinux blocking non-standard ports**
**Symptoms**: Service starts but connections are refused
**Solution**: Configure SELinux to allow Apache on port 5003
```bash
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 5003
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

### **Issue 3: Firewall blocking port 5003**
**Symptoms**: Local connections work but remote connections fail
**Solution**: Open port 5003 in firewall
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5003/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### **Issue 4: Multiple Listen directives conflict**
**Symptoms**: Apache starts but listens on wrong ports
**Solution**: Review all configuration files for conflicting directives
```bash
sudo grep -r "Listen" /etc/httpd/conf*
```
