  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   index.html
```

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Commit the File

```bash
git commit -m "Added index.html into nautilus branch"
```

**Purpose**: Commit the staged `index.html` file to the `nautilus` branch.

**Expected Output**:
```
[nautilus def5678] Added index.html into nautilus branch
 1 file changed, XX insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
```

**Verification**: The commit creates a new commit hash (e.g., `def5678`) on the `nautilus` branch.

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Switch to Master Branch

```bash
git checkout master
```

**Purpose**: Switch back to the `master` branch to prepare for merging.

**Expected Output**:
```
Switched to branch 'master'
```

**Verification**: Confirm you are on the `master` branch.

```bash
git branch
```

**Expected Output**:
```
  nautilus
* master
```

---

## 🔹 Step 10: Merge Nautilus Branch into Master

```bash
git merge nautilus
```

**Purpose**: Merge the changes from the `nautilus` branch into the `master` branch.

**Expected Output**:
```
Updating abc1234..def5678
Fast-forward
 index.html | XX ++++++++++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, XX insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
```

**Verification**: The merge should be a fast-forward, adding `index.html` to `master`.

---

## 🔹 Step 11: Verify Merge Success

```bash
ls -l
```

**Purpose**: Confirm that `index.html` is now present in the `master` branch.

**Expected Output**:
```
-rw-r--r--. 1 natasha natasha  XX Sep 18 13:31 index.html
[other repository files]
```

**Verification**: Check the commit history to ensure the merge was successful.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Expected Output**:
```
def5678 Added index.html into nautilus branch
abc1234 [previous commit message]
```

---

## 🔹 Step 12: Push Master Branch to Origin

```bash
git push origin master
```

**Purpose**: Push the updated `master` branch to the remote repository `origin`.

**Expected Output**:
```
To [remote repository URL]
   abc1234..def5678  master -> master
```

**Verification**: The `master` branch on the remote is updated with the new commit.

---

## 🔹 Step 13: Push Nautilus Branch to Origin

```bash
git push origin nautilus
```

**Purpose**: Push the `nautilus` branch to the remote repository `origin`.

**Expected Output**:
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Permission Denied When Accessing Repository**
**Symptoms**: Cannot access `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo`.
**Solution**: Verify `natasha` user has read/write access to the repository.
```bash
ls -ld /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
# Check if natasha has access
```

### **Issue 2: File Not Found in /tmp**
**Symptoms**: `cp /tmp/index.html .` fails because the file doesn’t exist.
**Solution**: Verify the file exists in `/tmp/`.
```bash
ls -l /tmp/index.html
# Ensure file is present and readable
```

### **Issue 3: Merge Conflicts**
**Symptoms**: `git merge nautilus` fails due to conflicts.
**Solution**: Check for conflicting changes and resolve them manually.
```bash
git status
# Resolve conflicts, then commit
git add .
git commit
```

### **Issue 4: Push Fails Due to Remote Issues**
**Symptoms**: `git push origin master` or `git push origin nautilus` fails.
**Solution**: Verify remote configuration and network access.
```bash
git remote -v
# Ensure origin is correctly set
```
